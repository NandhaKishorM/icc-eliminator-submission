# Virtual Reality Cricket Coaching with Cricketers Avatar
## Overview
This project provides virtual reality coaching for cricket with a 3D avatar of Virat Kohli, a famous Indian cricketer. The coaching covers multiple master batting classes, including the flick, cover drive, pull shot, and more. Users can access the training on the Meta Quest headset. The platform uses advanced technologies like Unreal Engine, MetaHuman 3D avatar creator platform, and AI based pose estimation to provide an immersive and engaging experience to the users.

## Todo List
1. **Adding Our Large Language Model based 3D avatar called CUTY which run on web and VR.**
We have developed a state-of-the-art **400M large language model with internet search capability**, using a **Transformer-based architecture similar to GPT**. It took two years to develop and includes API integration for highly intelligent interaction with a persona. **Turn ON the volume in the video to see it in action!**

2. Implement deep reinforcement learning to create an intelligent 3D avatar that can improve the user experience
3. Add more master classes for batting
4. Create an analytics dashboard to track user progress and performance
5. Integrate social media sharing features to allow users to share their experience with others
